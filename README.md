### Hi there, I'm Terodom ðŸ‘‹
Cheers, my name is Sebastian Muxel and i'm a Developer from Vorarlberg, Austria.
I'm a massive Linux Nerd and use it exclusively at home since 2016.
Since early 2020 i'm a professional Mobile Developer working with C# and Xamarin.Forms,  
but in my free time i use C++ extensively.  

Lately i have been very interested into Operating Systems, Device Drivers and Compilers  
so i'm starting to delve into that mess.
